				<p>Karl-Heinz-Rummenigge will step down as CEO of Bayern at the end of June. The club announced it a few minutes ago on his website. Another legend like Oliver Kahn will succeed him in office. "This is the most strategically sensible and logical moment," says Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. “It is the end of the financial year and a new section begins with a new team of coaches.

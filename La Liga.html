				<p> The young central Catalan has signed until 2026. Despite the interest of other clubs, Èric's priority has always been to sign for Barça.
					It's official. The prodigal son returns home. A few moments ago, Barça made official the incorporation of a player highly desired by the Blaugranas: Eric García. The "Canterano culé" who until now was a member of the Manchester City ranks of Pep Guardiola, returns home after four years with the sky blues. The Spanish defender has signed a contract until June 2026 with the Blaugrana club, with a termination clause of 400 million euros.</p>

				<p>Real Madrid surprises everyone again. Carlo Ancelotti, out of all the pools to succeed Zidane, returns to the white club. The La Décima coach is the solution that Florentino Pérez has found to the premature goodbye of the one who, at that time, was his assistant in charge of Real Madrid. After a discreet season at Everton, Madrid pulls the Italian after the good taste left in his first stage as a white coach.</p>

				<p>Leo Messi could be closer than ever to renewing with FC Barcelona. As the journalist Miguel Rico has commented, the Argentine would practically already have a closed agreement with Barça to stay until 2023. The deal would be pending "structural details" and it would be normal for it to be announced after the Copa América. In that sense, it was reported that the '10' has put much of the part of him to reach an understanding.</p>

				<h4>·Laporta hints that Koeman will continue as Barcelona coach</h4>

			<content>
				<p>The president of Barcelona, Joan Laporta, has appeared this Tuesday at a press conference during the presentation of Eric Garcia as a new player for the Blaugrana club and has reviewed the current situation of the club and the movements in the transfer market. The top leader, who was accompanied by the sports vice president, Rafael Yuste, and the football director, Mateu Alemany, left a headline on the situation of coach Ronald Koeman.
If this situation with the coach were a pool, without the X as an option, the president wanted to play and hinted that Koeman is closer to staying than to leave the club. "With Koeman, this is going to get better. I see more of a 1 than a 2."</p>

				<p>With the end of the leagues in Europe, the transfer market begins and also the always interesting awards ceremony for the highlights of the season. In England, an old acquaintance from Chile postulates an important award.
				Marcelo Bielsa was nominated for the best coach in the Premier League, a product of his great campaign with Leeds. The Rosario rose for this season from the Championship and with the sixteenth-lowest budget, he achieved a creditable ninth place, which left him within three points of qualification for European cups.</p>

				<h4>·Kanté and his meteoric rise in 8 years</h4>

				<p>To this day, any football fan would want to reincarnate in N’Golo Kanté. Currently, the Parisian is one of the players with the highest form of the old continent and his successes corroborate it. Last night, he was established as the MVP of the match for the third time in a row in the knockout round and added his first UEFA Champions League to their windows.

It is worth noting his trajectory from 2013 to 2021, as he went from practicing this sport in a humble division and made the leap to stardom in the most unlikely way possible. And it is that in 2013 the good Kanté militated in the ranks of Caen, which at that time belonged to Ligue 2. In that campaign, 12/13, the Viking team ascended as third to Ligue 1, where the midfielder would sign his debut in the French top division the following year. His first season in Primera left excellent sensations because he played 37 of the 38 possible games and became the third-best recovering player in Europe.

Such was his level in Gallic lands that he attracted attention in the British Isles. Leicester City, which at that time was a humble club and had managed to stay by the hair, decided to incorporate it for 9 million euros. He made his Premier League debut in 2015 and against all odds, Ranieri and his men produced one of the biggest events in football history: Leicester was crowned Premier League champions. The boom of the foxes was left for history and the most powerful entities began to dismantle the establishment of the feat.</p>

				<p>Chelsea defeated Manchester City 1-0 in the Champions League final, with a goal from Kai Havertz, this Saturday at the Estadio do Dragao, in Porto.

In the 42nd minute, Havertz received a 40-meter pass from Mason Mount, and after dodging the goalkeeper Ederson was sentenced at pleasure for the winning goal.

Thomas Tuchel's team was a real nightmare for Pep Guardiola's team. The pressure of the blues in the middle sector, an area to which the Catalan did not give muscle by dispensing with Fernandinho and Rodri from the beginning, took effect.</p>
